        Nobody’s born <strong>smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <strong>algebra</strong>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at <strong>first</strong>.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his <strong>ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <strong>stumble</strong>, <strong>slip</strong>, <strong>crawl</strong>, <strong>fall</strong> and <strong>fail</strong> and <strong>fall</strong>.<br>
        <em>Frustrating</em>. <em>Confusing</em>. <em>Trying</em>. <em>Struggling</em>.<br>
        Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each <strong>wrong answer</strong> making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <strong>learning</strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.
        Because the most <em>beautiful</em>, <em>complex</em> concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn <strong>anything</strong>.
